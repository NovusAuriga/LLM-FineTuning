## Some useful files to fine tune and benchmark the AIs, mostly aim to Math
The python-pytorch-opt-rocm package (python-pytorch-opt-rocm-2.5.1-7-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst) is the one used for this files, if you are using Arch Linux with an AMD graphic card, this should work. If you had trouble with torch to use your graphic card this package should fix it. 
- As well for ollama install: ``sudo pacman -S ollama-rocm``
This project is not intended to run and go, you need to modify paths, and other stuff.
