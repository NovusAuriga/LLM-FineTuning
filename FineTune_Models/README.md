Read this before executing any of the files, the files GMSK8-Qwen2.5-1.5b.py and GRPO-MathQA.py, are garbage, they where done before I could understand everything, just testing around, I'll keep working with them and trying to figure out stuff.
Feel free to play with the lora and grpo ones, they work well in a 7900XT gpu.
Note: GRPO kinda works, but could have a way better reward system, feel free to improve it.
